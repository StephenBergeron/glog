# glog

General logging utility. 
Enforce a simple log pattern for script execution and automation.

## Installation

Clone or download from https://github.com/StephenBergeron/glog
Typically I would clone into `${HOME}/projects/`. Assuming you use the same location, 
In your bash profile, source the `glog_env.bash` utility:
```bash
$ . ${HOME}/projects/glog/conf/glog_env.bash
```
You can use other location, as far as the bash_profile point to the correct location.

## Usage

glog 
FIXME: explanation

    $ java -jar glog-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]
